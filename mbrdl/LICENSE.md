This License governs use of the accompanying Model-Based Robust Deep Learning (MBRDL) repository and all accompanying utilities, forms, libraries, etc. ("Software"), and your use of the Software, Platform, Algorithms, and all Utilities constitutes acceptance of this license.

 

The Software was originally created by Alexander Robey, Hamed Hassani, and George J. Pappas and the Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania ("Licensor") to enable Faculty, Departments and Researchers for train models of natural variation as well as classifiers that are robust to natural variation in data.

 

You may use this Software WITHOUT CHARGE for any purpose, subject to the restrictions in this license. Some of those allowable uses or purposes which can be non-commercial are teaching, academic research, use in your own environment (whether that is a commercial, academic or non-profit company or organization) and personal experimentation.

 

You may use the software if you are a commercial entity. There are two things you cannot do with this Software: The first is you cannot incorporate it into a commercial product ("Commercial Use"), the second is you cannot distribute this software or any modifications ("Derivative Work") of this software and beyond that, you must share your changes to the Model-Based Robust Deep Learning (MBRDL) repository with Alexander Robey, Hamed Hassani, and George J. Pappas and the Model-Based Robust Deep Learning (MBRDL) repository Community. We want everyone to benefit from the use of this product, we want it to stay free, and we want to avoid it forking (or splintering) into disconnected versions. Therefore; you may not use or distribute this Software or any Derivative Works in any form for any purpose. Examples of prohibited purposes would be licensing, leasing, or selling the Software, or distributing the Software for use with other commercial products, or incorporating the Software into a commercial product.

 

You may create Derivative Works of the software for your own use. You may modify this Software and contribute it back to Alexander Robey, Hamed Hassani, and George J. Pappas and the Model-Based Robust Deep Learning (MBRDL) repository Community, but you may not distribute the modified Software; all distribution must happen via the Model-Based Robust Deep Learning (MBRDL) repository. You may not grant rights to the Software or Derivative Works to this software under this License. For example, you may not distribute modifications of the Software under any terms, or sublicense this software to others.

 

For purposes of clarity, this license covers your institution or organization, and all other institutions or organizations directly affiliated with your institution or organization. For example, in the case of a University, all campuses would be covered under this license and directly affiliated schools, such as members of a higher education consortium, would also be covered under this license. In the case of a non-profit institution, all subsidiaries and directly affiliated companies or entities would be covered.
